# Hotel_Reservation_App_using)android_studio
Hotel Reservation App is an Android application built using Java in Android Studio. This project offers a seamless hotel booking experience with a user-friendly interface, efficient reservation features, and smooth navigation, making it an ideal solution for managing hotel stays. I took the first homepage UI from the internet and then modified it myself. I also added other pages, integrated a weather API to display live weather information, and included a hotel booking feature.
